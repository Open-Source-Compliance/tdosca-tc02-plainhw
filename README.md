## Test Case Definition

### Structure

This test case follows the general pattern of a TDOSCA test case:
* It has its own repository [https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/tdosca-tc02-plainhw](https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/tdosca-tc02-plainhw)
* and contains the following parts:
  - **compliance-traps.md**: *describes the traps / challenges implemented by and in the test case* [used to manually control whether a tested compliance tool really overcomes all difficulties]
  - **input-sources**: *contains all sources to create the distributable (binary package)* [used by the tested tool to create the compliance artifacts]
  - **README.md**: *this file*
  - **reference-compliance-artifacts**: *the compliance compliance artifacts a tool (chain) must/should generate*
    - **bom.csv**: *a list of all differently licensed open source components of a package*
    - **oscf.md**: *the open source compliance file* [fulfills the compliance requirements if combined with the distributed source- or binary package]
    - **prerequisites.csv**: *a list of preinstalled tools and libs, required by the software but not delivered as part of the software package*

### Intention

The test data of this test case (the program sources in input-sources)

* can be compiled and installed by using the configure, make, make install triple
* consist of a c program and a c library as 3rd party component
* all objects functions are initialized and say hello
* The main project is licensed under the GPL-v2, its sub components under the the MIT license and the BSD-2-Clause.
* The 3rd party library is licensed under the Apache license
* For specific challanges of this test case the compliance-traps.md
